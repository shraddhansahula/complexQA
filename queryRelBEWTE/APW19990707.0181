	PINE RIDGE, S.D. (AP) -- President Clinton turned the attention  
of his national poverty tour today to arguably the poorest, most 
forgotten U.S. citizens of them all: American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was going to the Pine Ridge Reservation for a visit with  
the Oglala Sioux nation and to participate in a conference on 
Native American homeownership and economic development. He also was 
touring a housing facility and signing a pact with Oglala leaders 
establishing an empowerment zone for Pine Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
	But the main purpose of the visit -- the first to a reservation  
by a president since Franklin Roosevelt -- was simply to pay 
attention to American Indians, who are so raked by grinding poverty 
that Clinton's own advisers suggested he come up with special 
proposals geared specifically to the Indians' plight. 
</P>
<P>
	At Pine Ridge, a scrolling marquee at Big Bat's Texaco expressed  
both joy over Clinton's visit and wariness of all the official 
attention: ``Welcome President Clinton. Remember Our Treaties,'' 
the sign read. 
</P>
<P>
	According to statistics from the Census Bureau and the Bureau of  
Indian Affairs, there are 1.43 million Indians living on or near 
reservations. Roughly 33 percent of them are children younger than 
15, and 38 percent of Indian children aged 6 to 11 live in poverty, 
compared with 18 percent for U.S. children of all other races 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from that, only 63 percent of Indians are high school  
graduates. Twenty-nine percent are homeless, and 59 percent live in 
substandard housing. Twenty percent of Indian households on 
reservations do not have full access to plumbing, and the majority 
-- 53.4 percent -- do not have telephones. 
</P>
<P>
	The per capita income for Indians is $21,619, one-third less  
than the national per capita income of $35,225. An estimated 50 
percent of American Indians are unemployed, and at Pine Ridge the 
problem is even more chronic -- 73 percent of the people do not have 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, who visited the reservation last  
August, said Pine Ridge is a metaphor for the poverty tour, for it 
sits in Shannon County, the poorest census tract in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is generations of poverty on the Pine Ridge reservation,  
with very, very little progress,'' Cuomo said. ``We didn't get into 
this situation in a couple of weeks and we're not going to get out 
of it in a couple of weeks. It's going to take years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To begin addressing the housing problem, Clinton was announcing  
a partnership between the Treasury Department, the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development, tribal governments and mortgage 
companies to help 1,000 Indians become homeowners over the next 
three years -- a small number that nonetheless would double the 
number of government-insured home mortgages issued on tribal lands. 
Under the effort, ``one-stop mortgage centers'' would be opened at 
Pine Ridge and on the Navajo Reservation in Arizona to help 
streamline the mortgage lending process. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuomo said special steps were needed to help Indians create and  
own houses because the nature of the land on which they live 
effectively shuts them out of conventional home loan processes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The land is held in trust. The bank doesn't want to take it as  
collateral because it's in trust,'' Cuomo said. ``So the main asset 
on the reservation -- the land -- can't even be used.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, two of the country's largest municipal securities  
underwriters, Banc One Capital Markets and George K. Baum ; Co., 
were committing to underwriting $300 million in bonds annually for 
five years to create a market for reservation mortgages. Those 
bonds would help raise $1.5 billion that could then be lent to 
tribes, tribal housing authorities and individuals for buying 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was part of Clinton's four-day, cross-country  
tour to highlight the ``untapped markets'' in America's inner 
cities and rural areas.
